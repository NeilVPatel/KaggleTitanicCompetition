This project is aimed at leveraging advanced regression techniques to predict survival rates of passengers on the Titanic, based on a myriad of features provided in the Kaggle dataset. 

Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for the Titanic Survival Prediction competition, aiming to explore, analyze, and predict survival rates of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The project walks through data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and evaluation to understand the factors that influenced survival rates.
